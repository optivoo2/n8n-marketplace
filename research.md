Complete implementation roadmap
Unique Brazilian APIs to integrate
Monetization strategy (R$20k MRR potential)
Repository recommendations to clone
2. Working MCP Server (mcp-brazilian-utils/)
Complete TypeScript implementation with:
15+ Brazilian tools ready to use

Address services (CEP lookup, distance)
Finance tools (PIX QR, Boleto)
Business lookups (CNPJ details via ReceitaWS)

üöÄ Quick Start:
cd mcp-brazilian-utils
npm install
npm run build
npm start

üí° SDK Recommendation: TypeScript
I strongly recommend TypeScript MCP SDK because:
‚úÖ Official Anthropic support
‚úÖ Better n8n compatibility
‚úÖ More examples available
‚úÖ Superior async handling
üî• Unique APIs & Libraries to Make Your Project Stand Out:
1. Government APIs (Premium but Official)
Serpro DataValid - Official CPF/CNPJ validation
e-CAC API - Tax situation certificates
SPED APIs - Fiscal bookkeeping data
RENAVAM - Vehicle registration lookup
2. Free Brazilian Data Sources
Brasil.io - Open government data
IBGE APIs - Geographic/demographic data
BCB (Central Bank) - Exchange rates, SELIC
CVM Data - Stock market information
3. Unique Integrations No One Has

// Brazilian-specific that competitors miss:
- SPC/Serasa credit check integration
- Detran vehicle fine lookups
- FIPE vehicle price tables
- ANVISA medicine registry
- CRM/OAB professional registry validation
- Correios shipping calculator
- Brazilian holiday calculator (carnival, etc.)
- Union agreement (ACT/CCT) calculator
- CAGED employment data

4. Clone These for Faster Development:
# MCP Examples (study the patterns)
git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers

# Brazilian validation libraries
npm install brazilian-utils  # Most comprehensive
npm install validador-cpf-cnpj  # Lightweight
npm install pix-utils  # PIX payments
npm install node-correios  # Shipping

# Python alternatives (if you change your mind)
pip install brazilnum
pip install pycpfcnpj
pip install python-correios

üéØ Killer Features to Add:
1. Batch Processing API

2. Real-time Monitoring

// Monitor CNPJ status changes
async function monitorCNPJ(cnpj: string) {
  // Webhook when company status changes
  // Alert on bankruptcy, suspension, etc.
}
3. AI-Powered Data Extraction

// Extract data from unstructured documents
async function extractFromPDF(pdf: Buffer) {
  // Use OCR + AI to extract:
  // - CPF/CNPJ from contracts
  // - Addresses from invoices
  // - Tax data from receipts
}

4. Compliance Automation
// LGPD compliance checker
async function checkLGPDCompliance(website: string) {
  // Scan for privacy policy
  // Check cookie consent
  // Verify data handling
}
